This study investigates the chemical contrast between a dark black-crust band and the underlying stone substrate on the western enclosure wall of Golia Monastery (Iasi, Romania), using portable X-ray fluorescence (pXRF) as a non-invasive analytical tool. Fourteen in-situ measurements were performed on a single buttress to quantify key elements (S, Cl, Ca, Ti, Fe, Cu, Zn) and to enrichment factors. The results show that the wall is built of calcareous sandstone, while the black crust represents a composite deposit formed by gypsum crystallization within a matrix of siliciclastic dust and carbonate particles. Among all indicators, S/Ca exhibits the clearest contrast: the median S/Ca ratio in the crust (similar to 0.054) is approximately twice that of the substrate (similar to 0.025), yielding an enrichment factor EF(S/Ca) approximate to 2.1 and confirming sulfate enrichment and gypsum development on the exposed band. By contrast, Cl/Ca remains low in both zones, and Ti-normalized metal ratios (Cu/Ti, Zn/Ti, Fe/Ti) are strongly constrained by detection limits, preventing robust interpretation in terms of traffic-derived particulates. Small but measurable amounts of P suggest a certain degree of bioreceptivity of the crust surface, although this hypothesis requires microanalytical confirmation. From a Conservation Science perspective, the study demonstrates that pXRF-based ratio analysis can rapidly document sulfate-enriched black crusts on heritage stonework while also highlighting the limitations of trace-metal indicators in small in situ datasets and the need for combined chemical, microstructural, and biological approaches.

Transdermal drug delivery (TDD) systems are gaining attention due to their advantages, such as painless administration, controlled release, direct absorption into the bloodstream, and its ability to bypass hepatic metabolism. The thin films obtained via pulsed laser deposition consist of micro- and nanoparticles capable of migrating through skin pores upon contact. This study investigates the interaction of phenolic compounds in hemp seeds with pulsed laser beams. The main goal is to achieve the ablation and deposition of these compounds as thin films suitable for TDD applications. The other key objective is optimizing laser energy to enhance the industrial feasibility of this method. Thin layers were deposited on glass and hemp fabric using dual pulsed laser (DPL) ablation on a compressed hemp seed target held in a stainless steel ring. The target was irradiated for 30 min with two synchronized pulsed laser beams, each with parameters of 30 mJ, 532 nm, pulse width of 10 ns, and a repetition rate of 10 Hz. Each beam had an angle of incidence with the target surface of 45 degrees, and the angle between the two beams was also 45 degrees. To improve laser absorption, two approaches were used: (1) HS-DPL/glass and HS-DPL/hemp fabric, in which a portion of the stainless steel ring was included in the irradiated area, and (2) HST-DPL/glass and HST-DPL/hemp fabric-hemp seeds were mixed with turmeric powder, which is known to improve laser interaction and biocompatibility. The FTIR and Micro-FTIR spectroscopy (ATR) performed on thin films compared to the target material confirmed the presence of hemp-derived phenolic compounds, including tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), cannabidiol (CBD), ferulic acid, and coumaric acid, along with other functional groups such as amides. The ATR spectra have been validated against Gaussian 6 numerical simulations. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and substance transfer tests revealed the microgranular structure of thin films. Through the analyzes carried out, the following were highlighted: spherical structures (0.3-2 mu m) for HS-DPL/glass, HS-DPL/hemp fabric, HST-DPL/glass, and HST-DPL/hemp fabric; larger spherical structures (8-13 mu m) for HS-DPL/glass and HST-DPL/glass; angular, amorphous-like structures (similar to 3.5 mu m) for HS-DPL/glass; and crystalline-like structures (0.6-1.3 mu m) for HST-DPL/glass. Microparticle transfer from thin films on the hemp fabric to the filter paper at a human body temperature (37 degrees C) confirmed their suitability for TDD applications, aligning with the "whole plant medicine" or "entourage effect" concept. Granular, composite, thin films were successfully developed, capable of releasing microparticles upon contact with a surface whose temperature is 37 degrees C, specific to the human body. Each of the microparticles in the thin films obtained with the DPL technique contains phenolic compounds (cannabinoids and phenolic acids) comparable to those in hemp seeds, effectively acting as "microseeds." The obtained films are viable for TDD applications, while the DPL technique ensures industrial scalability due to its low laser energy requirements.

By heat treatment in air at 820 degrees C and 900 degrees C, for 30 min and 6 h, micro- and nanocomposite layers of Ga2Se3-Ga2O3 and beta-Ga2O3 (native oxide) with surfaces made of nanowires/nanoribbons were obtained. The obtained composite Ga2Se3-Ga2O3 and nanostructured beta-Ga2O3 are semiconductor materials with band gaps of 2.21 eV and 4.60 eV (gallium oxide) and photosensitivity bands in the green-red and ultraviolet-C regions that peaked at 590 nm and 262 nm. For an applied voltage of 50 V, the dark current in the photodetector based on the nanostructured beta-Ga2O3 layer was of 8.0 x 10-13 A and increased to 9.5 x 10-8 A upon 200 s excitation with 254 nm-wavelength radiation with a power density of 15 mW/cm2. The increase and decrease in the photocurrent are described by an exponential function with time constants of tau 1r = 0.92 s, tau 2r = 14.0 s, tau 1d = 2.18 s, tau 2d = 24 s, tau 1r = 0.88 s, tau 2r = 12.2 s, tau 1d = 1.69 s, and tau 2d = 16.3 s, respectively, for the photodetector based on the Ga2Se3-Ga2S3-GaSe composite. Photoresistors based on the obtained Ga2Se3-Ga2O3 composite and nanostructured beta-Ga2O3 layers show photosensitivity bands in the spectral range of electronic absorption bands of ozone in the same green-red and ultraviolet-C regions, and can serve as ozone sensors (detectors).

Understanding the PBL allows us to estimate air quality, provide weather forecasts, and establish correlations with astronomical seeing conditions and atmospheric turbulence intensity. The PBL can be defined in many ways, but its importance remains constant as it is the atmospheric layer where most socioeconomic activities occur. In this letter, we present a method to predict the stochastic PBL height (SPBLH) using ceilometer data and a deep learning approach based on a fully connected neural network (NN). We found a correlation between the Lyapunov coefficient calculated for each SPBLH time series and the loss function, which is influenced by various factors such as atmospheric parameters, pollution, aerosols, and more. The performance of a typical NN used to predict a time series is significantly affected by the degree of chaos, quantified by the largest Lyapunov exponents (LLEs). Our results show a decrease in accuracy as a function of increasing LLE. Moreover, an increased number of virtual neurons in the NN can be detrimental to SPBLH prediction for the complex dynamics of the PBL due to atmospheric conditions and unforeseen events.

IMPACT OF HYDROCHLORIC ACID (HCL) TREATMENT ON DIATOMITE PURITY AND STRUCTURAL MODIFICATIONS FOR ADVANCED PHOTOVOLTAIC APPLICATIONS	ROMANIAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICS			English	Article						Silicon; silica; X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS); photovoltaic cells; the purity; HCl	DRUG-DELIVERY; SILICON; SYSTEM; GENOME	Our work focused to prepare diatomite-silica that can be reduced to silicon, Algerian diatomite was synthesized through a chemical method. This research aimed to study the influence of acid treatment and grinding on diatomite's impurity level. An analysis of the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) showed a decrease in the concentration of impurities in the diatomite. A hydrochloric acid (HCl) concentration that's 4 mol/L resulted into a soft leaching of most organics such as carbon, but still retained impurities. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis also confirmed that the chemical configuration of SiO2 was barely altered. In comparison, grinding led to an invasion of diatomite by impurities and to structural disorders. These findings are relevant for encouraging work on purification steps which facilitate the extraction of non-pertaining silica while producing solar silicon for solar cells.

In the present study, two synanthropic bird species, namely, the feral pigeon (Columba livia f. domestica) and the rook (Corvus frugilegus), were employed as bioindicators to assess the atmospheric trace metal pollution in Iasi City, Romania. The concentrations of Ni, Pb, Cd, Co, Cr, and Cu were determined through high-resolution continuum source graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry (HR-CS GF-AAS) of various tissues, including the liver, kidney, lung, heart, muscle, and bone, of feral pigeons and rooks collected in Iasi City. The order of trace metal concentrations in the tissues of feral pigeons and rooks in Iasi City was similar: Cu > Pb > Ni > Cd > Cr > Co. However, trace element values in most tissues were higher in the rook samples than in feral pigeon ones, except for Co, which had elevated levels in feral pigeon renal and cardiac tissues, and Cu, which registered the highest concentrations in feral pigeon liver and kidney tissues. While not statistically significant, Pb concentration values in the PM10 fraction of atmospheric particles positively correlated with Pb concentrations in rook kidney samples (p = 0.05). The concentration levels of Cd, Pb, and Ni in the PM10 fraction of air particles showed a positive correlation with Cd levels in the samples of pigeon heart and rook liver, kidney, and heart, Pb levels in the samples of pigeon kidney, heart, and muscle and rook liver and bone, and Ni levels in the samples of pigeon liver, kidney, and bone and rook liver, muscle, and bone, respectively.

The fluid Plateau-Rayleigh (PRI), Rayleigh-Taylor (RTI), and Richtmyer-Meshkov (RMI) instabilities, as well as the crown splash induced during the pulsed laser deposition (PLD) in the high energy regime, resulting in ring and pearl-shaped structures, offer the benefit of an increased sorption surface. These morphological structures obtained for the silver thin layers make them of interest for catalytic applications. This study addresses both fundamental and applied issues on the morphological structures obtained for the silver thin layers and their catalytic function in organic processes. In this sense, the catalytic action of the thin silver layer was highlighted by modifications of the Reactive Blue 21 dye (C.I.) in an aqueous solution with sodium bicarbonate. Specific investigations and analyses were carried out using electron microscopy and elemental analysis (SEM-EDX), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and profilometry, mass spectrometry, ablation plasma diagnosis, diffractograms (XRD), as well as IR spectroscopy (FTIR). In addition to the experimental investigation and analyses, the simulation of the ionization energy threshold was conducted in COMSOL for complementary evaluation on the involved processes and phenomena.

The defects on the (0001) surface of GaSe:Eu plates serve as nucleation centers of beta-Ga2O3:Eu crystallites. For 0.02 at. % Eu doping, the fundamental absorption edge of GaSe:Eu crystals at room temperature is formed by n = 1 direct excitons, while at 3.00 at. % doping, Eu completely shields the electron-hole bonds. The band gap of nanostructured beta-Ga2O3:Eu layer, determined from diffuse reflectance spectra, depends on the dopant concentration and ranges from 4.64 eV to 4.87 eV, for 3.00 and 0.05 at. % doping, respectively. At 0.02 at. % doping level, the PL spectrum of epsilon-GaSe:Eu single crystals consists of the n = 1 exciton band, together with the impurity band with a maximum intensity at 800 nm. Fabry-Perrot cavities with a width of 9.3 mu m are formed in these single crystals, which determine the interference structure of the impurity PL band. At 1.00-3.00 at. % Eu concentrations, the PL spectra of GaSe:Eu single crystals and beta-Ga2O3:Eu nanowire/nanolamellae layers are determined by electronic transitions of Eu2+ and Eu3+ ions.

The unit comprised 12 enclosed concrete basins with a capacity of ten cubic meters of water, populated with 150 kg of fish each. Fish were subjected to a clinical examination on the site, after which whole fish were harvested for a bacteriological and histopathological examination. Water quality parameters were examined using classic biochemical methods and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy in order to find out whether the environment in which the fish live is also a predisposing factor that could facilitate different pathogens and induce a state of disease in the fish. Real-time PCR was performed on strains of Aeromonas spp. sampled from the fish to accurately identify the pathogen species. The goal was to accurately identify the problems and predisposing factors that lead to disease outbreaks.

Aspects related to changes in the morphological structure of the thin layer but also to the chemical composition of the obtained thin layer were analyzed and compared with the target as well as with the thin layers obtained with a higher power pulsed laser in a single-pulsed (SPL) regime. Orthorhombic structures were noticed with Scanning Electron Microscopy for the thin film obtained in DPL mode compared to the irregular particles obtained in SPL mode. The deacetylation process during ablation was evidenced by Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy, resulting in chitosan-based thin films. The effect of the obtained thin films of chitosan on the cells of baker's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) was studied. Restoration of the yeast paste into initial yeast was noticed mainly when the hemp fabric was used as support for the coating with yeas which was after that coated with chitosan thin film produced by DPL method.

The influence of substrate type and Cr addition on structural, optical and ferroelectric properties of bismuth ferrite (BFO) based thin films was investigated. X-ray diffraction measurements showed the formation of different phases depending on the substrate used for sample growth. Compared to the BFO film deposited on FTO (F-SnO2), the Cr-doped BFO (BFCO) sample on SrTiO3 (STO) exhibits higher photodegradation efficiency (52.3% vs. 27.8%). The enhanced photocatalytic activity of BFCO is associated with a lower energy band gap (1.62 eV vs. 1.77 eV). The application of ultrasonic-wave vibrations simultaneously with visible light improved 2.85 times and 1.86 times the photocatalytic degradation efficiencies of BFO/FTO and BFCO/STO catalysts, respectively. The piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) measurements showed that both catalysts exhibit ferroelectric behavior, but a higher piezoelectric potential was evidenced in the case of the BFO/FTO thin film. The enhancement of piezo-photodegradation efficiency was mainly attributed to the piezoelectric-driven separation and transport of photo-generated carriers toward the surface of the photocatalyst.

Analytical and spectroscopic methods were used to investigate the waters of a canal situated in the neighbourhood of the landfill. Dangerous chemical compounds have been identified in the water as pollutants resulting from the physico-chemical processes of degradation of landfill waste. The quick method with gas sensor detection and colorimetric ion identification using a commercial Quantofix kit, as well as precipitation with AgNO3, offered preliminary information completed by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR). Pollutants that reached the canal waters either by air (evaporation) or by discharges or through rainwater were analysed from the point of view of the degree of danger, sources of waste materials, as well as their circuit in the environment.

Their single crystals are formed by planar packings of S/Se-Ga-Ga-S/Se type, with weak polarization bonds between them, which allows obtaining, by splitting, plan-parallel lamellae with atomically smooth surfaces. By heat treatment in a normal or water vapor-enriched atmosphere, their plates are covered with a layer consisting of & beta;-Ga2O3 nanowires/nanoribbons. In this work, the elemental and chemical composition, surface morphology, as well as optical, photoluminescent, and photoelectric properties of & beta;-Ga2O3 layer formed on GaSxSe1-x (0 & LE; x & LE; 1) solid solutions (as substrate) are studied. The correlation is made between the composition (x) of the primary material, technological preparation conditions of the oxide-semiconducting layer, and the optical, photoelectric, and photoluminescent properties of & beta;-Ga2O3 (nanosized layers)/GaSxSe1-x structures. From the analysis of the fundamental absorption edge, photoluminescence, and photoconductivity, the character of the optical transitions and the optical band gap in the range of 4.5-4.8 eV were determined, as well as the mechanisms behind blue-green photoluminescence and photoconductivity in the fundamental absorption band region. The photoluminescence bands in the blue-green region are characteristic of & beta;-Ga2O3 nanowires/nanolamellae structures. The photoconductivity of & beta;-Ga2O3 structures on GaSxSe1-x solid solution substrate is determined by their strong fundamental absorption. As synthesized structures hold promise for potential applications in UV receivers, UV-C sources, gas sensors, as well as photocatalytic decomposition of water and organic pollutants.

In this paper, we report on the fabrication and characterization of a TiO2-SiO2 nanocomposite disk-shaped target. The target was used for the deposition of TiO2-SiO2 nanocomposite thin films on fluorine-doped tin oxide/glass substrates using the pulsed laser deposition (PLD) technique. The thicknesses of the thin films were fixed to 100 nm, and the deposition temperature ranged from room temperature to 300 degrees C. As revealed by the microstructural and morphological characterizations revealed, the TiO2-SiO2 nanocomposite thin films are amorphous and display homogeneous distribution. The determined values of the indirect optical band gap range from 2.92 to 3.07 eV, while those of the direct optical band gap lie between 3.50 and 3.55 eV. Additionally, as the deposition temperature decreases, the light transmission increases in the visible and in the ultraviolet ranges, which is suitable for flexible perovskite solar cells. This research can uncover new insights into the fabrication of amorphous TiO2-SiO2-based nanostructured thin films using the PLD technique for perovskite solar cell technology.

The effects of substrate temperature, Ar:O2 mass flow ratio and gas mixture pressure on the films' microstructure, phase evolution, optic, ferroelectric and magnetic properties were systematically investigated. The structural analysis results revealed an amorphous phase for the films deposited at a substrate temperature below 500 degrees C, while for the thin films deposited at 700 degrees C, a epsilon-Fe2O3 secondary phase was detected. The diffraction lines of the samples deposited at 600 degrees C were associated with Bi2Fe4O9 and Bi25FeO40 phases. The increase in the mixture gas pressure up to 1 Pa showed an improved crystallinity of the deposited films, while, at higher working gas pressures, the films were found to be amorphous. The use of low O2 to Ar mass flow ratio during the deposition led to a phase transformation process. EDX and RBS measurements exposed a uniform distribution of the main elements, revealing some stoichiometry changes induced by the pressure variation. The optical band gap values were influenced by the substrate temperature and pressure of the Ar:O2 gas. The magnetic properties were correlated with the structural features, the highest magnetic response being observed for the sample deposited at 600 degrees C, 1 Pa and 3:1 Ar:O2 gas pressure. According to the PFM results, the film deposited at 700 degrees C, Ar:O2 ratio 3:1 and total gas pressure 1 Pa clearly outperformed the others due to their excellent ferroelectric properties and outstanding piezo-response. The sample deposited at 700 degrees C showed both visible light-driven degradation and piezodegradation activities. The piezocatalytic and photocatalytic activities were ascribed to the high piezoresponse and to a more efficient separation of electrons and holes induced by a built-in electric field that is caused by the larger remnant polarization of Bi2Fe4O9 and Bi2Fe4O9/epsilon-Fe2O3 hetero-junction.

The analyses performed by spectroscopic techniques (Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy-FTIR, Laser-Induced Fluorescence Spectroscopy-LIF, Scanning Electron Microscopy coupled with Energy Dispersive X-ray-SEM-EDX, Atomic Force Microscopy-AFM and optical microscope) evidenced that a biocomposite consisting of lignin, cellulose, hemicellulose, waxes, sugars and phenolyc acids p-coumaric and ferulic, similar to the hemp stalk target was obtained. Nanostructures and aggregated nanostructures of 100 nm to 1.5 mu m size were evidenced. Good mechanical strength and its adherence to the substrate were also noticed. It was noticed that the content in calcium and magnesium increased compared to that of the target from 1.5% to 2.2% and from 0.2% to 1.2%, respectively. The COMSOL numerical simulation provided information on the thermal conditions that explain phenomena and processes during laser ablation such as C-C pyrolisis and enhanced deposition of calcium in the lignin polymer matrix. The good gas and water sorption properties due to the free OH groups and to the microporous structure of the new biocomposite components recommends it for studies for functional applications in medicine for drug delivery devices, filters in dialysis and for gas and liquid sensors. Functional applications in solar cells windows are also possible due to the conjugated structures of the contained polymers.

J	Irimiciuc, SA; Bulai, G; Gurlui, S				Irimiciuc, Stefan Andrei; Bulai, Georgiana; Gurlui, Silviu			Rare earth effect on laser produced plasma dynamics during pulsed laser deposition of doped cobalt ferrite	SPECTROCHIMICA ACTA PART B-ATOMIC SPECTROSCOPY			English	Article						Rare earth doped cobalt ferrite plasma; Optical emission spectroscopy; ICCD imaging; Target doping effect on plasma parameters	ABLATION PLUME; AMBIENT GAS; FILMS; NANOPARTICLES; SPECTROSCOPY; TEMPERATURE; CO	The addition of rare earth elements the ferrites can lead to significant changes in structural, magnetic and electric properties of bulk materials and also of thin films deposited by pulsed laser deposition. The present study relies on the analysis of the laser induced plasma of three sets of cobalt ferrite targets doped with various concen-trations of RE elements (Dy, Gd, Yb) and proposes a correlation of the derived results with structural in-vestigations of the films obtained during the same experiment. ICCD imaging and space-and time-resolved optical emission spectroscopy techniques were used to obtain information on the dynamics and excitation temperatures of various species found in the laser produced plasmas (LPP). Initial investigations on the global behavior of the LPP revealed that the addition of RE reduced the drift velocities of the formed plasma structures, the lowest ones being observed for the targets doped with the heaviest RE (Yb). Space-and time-resolved spectroscopy measurements applied for all main elements (Fe, Co and RE -both neutral and ionic species) showed a complex dynamic system, with decreased/increased kinetic energies for neutrals/ions at high dopant concentrations, suggesting a possible re-sputtering effect at the films surface. The individual excitation tem-peratures of the main elements derived from Boltzmann plots increased as the RE content was augmented via radiative collision events due to their larger diameters compared with Co, Fe or O. The spatial distribution of electron temperature can be explained by the charge separation occurring with the addition of RE in the investigated systems.

In order to protect the petroleum transportation pipes against the harmful H2S action, two ceramic materials as thin layers are proposed. In this article, pulsed laser deposition (PLD) of ceramic layers by in situ time-resolved optical techniques is investigated. Two ceramic materials were used as targets and real-time monitoring of the PLD process was realized via ICCD fast camera imaging and optical emission spectroscopy. The space-time displacement of the ceramic emissions was analyzed in order to determine the plasma structure and respective kinetic energies. Spectral-resolved investigation allowed the determination of plasma species individual velocities (in the first case: 43 km/s for C ionic species, 11 km/s for Si, from 25 to 5 km/s for atomic species; in the second case: 32 km/s for C ionic species, 11 km/s for W species, and 15 and 53 km/s for neutral species). SEM and AFM techniques were implemented to analyze the resulting ceramic layers showing homogeneous surfaces with characteristic material droplets.

The Raman spectrum of In2O3 layers on an InSe:Sn substrate, in the wavelength range of 105-700 cm(-1), contains the vibration band characteristic of the cubic (bcc-In2O3) phase. As revealed by EDX spectra, the In2O3 layer, similar to 2 mu m thick, formed on InSe:Cd contains an similar to 18% excess of atomic oxygen. The absorption edge of InSe:Sn (Cd)/In2O3 structures was studied by ultraviolet reflectance spectroscopy and found to be 3.57 eV and similar to 3.67 eV for InSe:Cd and InSe:Sn substrates, respectively. By photoluminescence analysis, the influence of doping impurities on the emission bands of In2O3 :Sn (Cd) was revealed and the energies of dopant-induced and oxygen-induced levels created by diffusion into the InSe layer from the InSe/In2O3 interface were determined. The n (p)-InSe/In2O3 structures display a significantly wide spectral range of photosensitivity (1.2-4.0 eV), from ultraviolet to near infrared. The influence of Cd and Sn concentrations on the photosensitivity and recombination of nonequilibrium charge carriers in n (p)-InSe layers from the heterojunction interface was also studied. The as-obtained nanosized InSe/In2O3 structures are suitable for optoelectronic applications.

The new method can lead to a cutting-edge technology, as a response to the concern regarding the accumulation of "natural biological waste" and its use. The process consists of high-power laser irradiation applied on oyster shells as the target and deposition of the ablated material on different substrates. The obtained thin films we analyzed by FTIR, UV-VIS and LIF spectroscopy, as well as SEM-EDS and AFM. All the results indicated that chitin was extracted from the shell composite material and converted to chitosan by deacetylation. It was, thus, evidenced that chemical transformation in the chitin polymer side-chain occurs during laser irradiation of the oyster shell and in the resulted plasma plume of ablation. The numerical simulation in COMSOL performed for this study anticipates and confirms the experimental results of chitin deacetylation, also providing information about the conditions required for the physico-chemical processes involved. The high sorption properties of the thin films obtained by a LICD procedure is evidenced in the study. This quality suggests that they should be used in transdermal patch construction due to the known hemostatic and antibacterial effects of chitosan. The resulting composite materials, consisting of the chitosan thin films deposited on hemp fabric, are also suitable for micro-filters in water decontamination or in other filtering processes.

From this perspective and based on Jaynes' remark (any circumstance left unspecified in the description of any complex system dynamics has the concrete expression in the existence of an invariance group), in the present paper one specifies such unspecified circumstances that result directly from the consideration of the canonical formalism induced by the SL(2R) as invariance group. It follows that both the Hamiltonian function and the Guassian distribution acquire the status of invariant group functions, the parameters that define the Hamiltonian acquire statistical significances based on a principle of maximizing informational energy, the class of statistical hypotheses specific to Gaussians of the same average acts as transitivity manifolds of the group (transitivity manifolds which can be correlated with the multifractal-non-multifractal scale transitions), joint invariant functions induced through SL(2R) groups isomorphism (the SL(2R) variables group, and the SL(2R) parameters group, etc.). For an ensemble of oscillators of the same frequency, the unspecified circumstances return to the ignorance of the amplitude and phase of each of the oscillators, which forces the recourse to a statistical ensemble traversed by the transformations of the Barbilian-type group. Finally, the model is validated based on numerical simulations and experimental results that refer to transient phenomena in ablation plasmas. The novelty of our model resides in the fact that fractalization through stochasticization is imposed through group invariance, situation in which the group's transitivity manifolds can be correlated with the scale resolution.

During this period, the Chisinau AERONET monitoring site was not operational. The incentive for the investigation was the discovery of a high sediment load in rainwater collected on 12 May 2020 in Pelinia, a village in the Dochia district of the Republic of Moldova, in the southeastern part of Europe (47.8780 latitude, 27.8344 longitude), which could have originated from the Saharan dust storm. Backward trajectory analysis with NOAA's HYSPLIT model confirmed that the Saharan dust storm impacted the village of Pelinia. Scanning electron microscopy coupled with electron dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis of Pelinia rainwater sediments confirmed the chemical composition and morphological structure of Saharan dust particles. The particle size of the sediments matched the measurements at the AOD stations at Timisoara and Magurele, supporting the suggestion that Saharan dust probably entered the Republic of Moldova from Romania. FTIR analysis identified chemical compounds such as carbon dioxide, carbonates, sulfates, ferrocyanides, and organics (amines, amides, polypeptides, imines, oximes, pyrroles, aldehydes, sulfoxides, sulfones, nitro-derivatives) that were adsorbed and/or absorbed from the atmosphere, consistent with Saharan dust aerosols. Bio-allergens such as pollen were detected in the SEM images, showing the role of Saharan dust in transporting and spreading this kind of biological material.

These presented different appearance characteristics from those of the materials and rocks specific to the respective area. Spectroscopic and petrographic analyses were performed to identify the composition, morphological and crystallinity characteristics in order to elucidate the nature of the collected rock samples. Using FTIR spectroscopy functional groups, as those reported in the literature for Murchison, Bells and Allende, carbonaceous chondrite meteorites were identified. The fragments evidenced topography and morphology that can be assigned to the chondrules and chondrites of carbonaceous meteorites (CMs). The material in the fragments proved to be as insoluble organic material (IOM), being insoluble in water and organic solvents. Its crystalline structure was also evidenced by XRD analysis and FTIR spectrum. These physico-chemical properties, in relation to the sonic boom perceived in the area from where they were collected, indicate the spatial origin of the fragments of rock as possible meteorite fragments.

Seventy samples of each composite resin: Grandio Flow (VOCO, Germany)-group A, Filtek Ultimate Flow (3M-ESPE, MN, USA)-group B, G-aenial Flo X (GC Europe)-group C were prepared, submersed in hydrochloric acid 30% for 60 min and then submitted to simulated toothbrushing procedure using 5000 cycles with toothbrushes with medium and hard bristles, immediately after the chemical attack, after 30 min or without any chemical attack. The sample's surface roughness was analyzed using a noncontact profilometer (Dektak XT, Bruker, USA). ANOVA and post hoc Bonferroni tests, with a p < 0.05, were used to analyze the values. Hydrochloric acid action for 60 min and six months of toothbrushing using toothbrushes having medium hardness or firm bristles affects the surface roughness of tested flowable composite resins. Toothbrushing with firm bristles immediately after acidic challenge determines increased surface roughness for two of the three flowable composite resins (Grandio Flow and Filtek Ultimate Flow). Toothbrushing with medium or firm bristles thirty minutes after the acidic aggression determine no effect on surface condition of flowable composite resins.

Using the pulsed laser deposition (PLD) method applied to a silver target with impurities of nickel and iron, the formation of the silver citrate film is performed in various ways and the results are discussed based on Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) and Scanning Electron Microscopy coupled with Energy Dispersive X-ray (SEM-EDX) spectroscopy analyses. A mechanism of the physico-chemical processes that take place based on the FTIR vibrational modes and the elemental composition established by the SEM-EDS analysis is proposed. Inhibition of the fermentation process of Saccharomyces cerevisae is demonstrated for the nanocomposite material of the silver citrate thin layer, obtained by means of the PLD method, on hemp fabric. The usefulness of composite materials of this type can extend from sensors and optoelectronics to the medical fields of analysis and treatment.

The study refers to the pulsed laser deposition method (PLD) applied on turmeric target in order to obtain thin layers. Under high power laser irradiation of 532 nm wavelength, thin films containing curcuminoids were obtained on different substrates such as glass and quartz (laboratory investigation) and hemp fabric (practical application). Compared FTIR, SEM-EDS and LIF analyses proved that the obtained thin film chemical composition is mainly demethoxycurcumin and bisdemethoxycurcumin which is evidence that most of the curcumin from turmeric has been demethixylated during laser ablation. Silanol groups with known role into dermal reconstruction are evidenced in both turmeric target and curcuminoid thin films. UV-VIS reflection spectra show the same characteristics for all the curcuminoid thin films, indicating that the method is reproducible. The method proves to be successful for producing a composite material, namely curcuminoid transdermal patch with silanol groups, using directly turmeric as target in the thin film deposited by pulsed laser technique. Double layered patch curcuminoid-silver was produced under this study, proving compatibility between the two deposited layers. The silver layer added on curcuminoid-silanol layer aimed to increase antiseptic properties to the transdermal patch.

Three types of targets were used, unsintered (pressed at room temperature), sintered at 500 degrees C and sintered at 1000 degrees C. The surface morphology of the samples was investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and profilometry was used for thickness measurements. The structural properties of the films were examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD), while their optical properties were studied by UV-vis spectroscopy. The obtained TiO2 thin films have an amorphous nature, as shown by XRD analysis. Profilometer showed that sintered target samples have more reliable thicknesses than unsintered ones. The SEM studies revealed the sufficient structural homogeneity of sintered target nanosized TiO2 films and agglomerates in the case of unsintered target film. The UV-vis transmittance spectra showed high transparency in the visible range of PLD films, proportional to the target sintering temperature. The optical band gaps of the films deposited using the 500 degrees C and 1000 degrees C sintered targets are closer to those of anatase and rutile phases, respectively, which provides a promising approach to the challenges of amorphous TiO2-based nanostructures.

It is common knowledge that permanent exposure to urban atmosphere triggers degradation processes on the surfaces of natural stone monuments, especially on porous stone surfaces. This research was done on samples of porous calcareous rocks similar to the natural stone used in numerous historical monuments of Iasi City. These samples were film-coated with various commercially available hydrophobization solutions. Moreover, these samples were exposed in the immediate vicinity of a road junction with intensive and growing traffic. After about seven months of exposure, the apparent changes in the treated surfaces were compared with the untreated control surfaces (control samples) subjected to the same urban air exposure conditions over the same period of time to assess the effectiveness of the coating treatment.

Space-and time-resolved optical emission spectroscopy and ICCD fast camera imaging were implemented to understand the kinetics of the ablated particles and how the samples physical properties can be reflected by those of the plasma plume. Strong correlations were found between the global and individual plasma velocity and the melting temperature of the geomaterials. The thermal energy of the plasma expressed through the excitation temperature of the ejected particle is correlated with the same target physical parameter, results corelated with the presence of strong thermal ejection mechanisms. To better understand the global empirical laws, we implemented the fractal model to interpret the results.

Azo-polysiloxanes spontaneous surface relief grating by pulsed laser irradiation	APPLIED PHYSICS A-MATERIALS SCIENCE & PROCESSING			English	Article						Azo-polymers; Surface relief gratings; Polysiloxane; Laser; Nanostructuration	POLYMER; PHOTOFLUIDISATION; MECHANISM; COMPOUND; SUPPORTS; MODEL	In the herein paper, the possibility of obtaining spontaneous surface relief gratings (SSRGs) on azo-polymeric film surfaces, using a single laser beam of 1.13 mJ energy in pulse mode, was investigated. Chain rigidity is essential to have SSRG of reasonable quality so three azo modified polymers, with different main-chain rigidity, were considered: poly(chloromethyl styrene) (PCMS), a linear polysiloxanes and a cyclic polysiloxane. The AFM studies on azo-polysiloxanes revealed unregulated networks with amplitudes of only 1 nm, while on PCMS orderly SSRGs were observed. These results showed that the more rigid azo-polymer, PCMS, had better capacity to generate SSRGs of high quality. The SSRG periodicity was correlated with the number of laser pulses, i.e. higher pulse number led to lower periodicity. The SSRGs formation was associated with polymeric chains self-organization favoured by photo-fluidisation.

In order to obtain novel polyimide/metal nano hybrid materials, conductive Ni/Cu nanoparticles were embedded on polyimide substrates, using laser ablation technique. The morphology of the resulted thin metal layers was investigated using atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). The results highlighted different surface characteristics of the auto-organized metallic/polymer nanoparticles, depending on the chemical structure of the polyimide substrate, the parameters of the laser ablation setup, the deposition time, the type of the metallic target. The obtained features of these polyimide/metal nano hybrid materials can be employed as an indicator of the possibility of using them for potential applications as conductive circuits or substrates for adhesion control.

The overall emission was investigated by ICCD fast camera imaging and revealed the structuring of C-LPP into four distinct structures with different evolutions. The dynamic of the C-LPP was analyzed on various expansion directions in order to understand the formation of the main CN dominant structure and of lateral "flaps" with dominant C-2 emission. The kinetic and thermal energies of the resulted atoms, ions and molecules were investigated by means of space-and time-resolved optical emission spectroscopy and using the Boltzmann plot and Stark broadening approaches. The effect of the background gas pressure on the formation of molecular carbon structures is discussed and an optimum range of working pressure which maximizes the generation of C-2 is found.

The deposition process was monitored with an ICCD (Intensified Coupled Charged Device) fast gated camera and a high-resolution spectrometer. The global dynamics of the laser produced plasma showed a self-structuring into three components with different composition and kinetics. The optical emission spectroscopy revealed the formation of a stoichiometric plasma and proved that the segregation in the kinetic energy of the plasma structure is also reflected by the individual energies of the ejected particles. Atomic Force Microscopy was also implemented to investigate the properties and the quality of the deposited film. The presence of micrometric clusters was seen at a high laser fluence deposition with in-situ ICCD imaging. We developed a fractal model based on Schrodinger type functionalities. The model can cover the distribution of the excited states in the laser produced plasma. Moreover, we proved that SL(2R) invariance can facilitate plasma substructures synchronization through a self-modulation in amplitude.

In-situ plasma monitoring was implemented by means of space- and time-resolved optical emission spectroscopy, and ICCD fast camera imaging. Structural and chemical analyses were performed on the thin films using SEM, AFM, EDS, and XRD equipment. The deposition parameters influence on the chemical composition of the thin films was investigated. The peeled layer presented on DSC a solid-state transformation in a different transformation domain compared to the target properties. A fractal model was used to describe the dynamics of laser produced plasma through various non-differentiable functionalities. Through hydrodynamic type regimes, space-time homographic transformations were correlated with the global dynamics of the ablation plasmas. Spatial simultaneity of homographic transformation through a special SL(2R) invariance implies the description of plasma dynamics through Riccati type equations, establishing correlations with the optical emission spectroscopy measurements.

J	Cocean, I; Cocean, A; Iacomi, F; Gurlui, S				Cocean, Iuliana; Cocean, Alexandru; Iacomi, Felicia; Gurlui, Silviu			City water pollution by soot-surface-active agents revealed by FTIR spectroscopy	APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	3rd International Workshop on Graphene and C3N4-Based Photocatalysts (IWGCP)	MAR 23-26, 2019	Wuhan Univ Technol, Wuhan, PEOPLES R CHINA		Wuhan Univ Technol	Soot-surface-active composite; Sulfonic groups; Foaming rain; Sodium aluminate; Flocculation	REMOVAL	The aim of the study presented in this paper is to investigate and evaluate the water contamination during different episodes of pollution, with different symptoms that proved to be generated by the same contaminant source, the soot. FTIR investigation on diesel cars muffler-collected compound proved that the soot is a composite structure where agglomerations of granular phases in the experiment are incorporated in matrix of continuous films phase. Experimental investigation and spectra of the separated two phases confirmed this supposition. Similar spectra were obtained for the particles remained on the filter paper from filtering the foaming rain water from the streets of two major Romanian cities in the spring after a dry winter, sulfonic groups R - SO3- being identified in both cases. The surfactant structures have also been identified in the FTIR spectra for the continuous phase prepared from the liquid resulted from the same filtration process of foaming rain waters. Due to its ampholytic character, part of the surface active compound, remained bonded to the insoluble particles from soot through its hydrophobic region, and part of it bonded with water through its hydrophilic region, i.e. sulfonic groups. The same sulfonic groups had been detected before in the air and reported in a study. The source is herein identified as the soot from diesel fuel combustion dispersed in the air and the sink is proved to be the rain that washes it down to the ground. The source of foaming was found within this study as being surfactants added to the diesel fuel for cleaning the engine and those were mixed with the soot during combustion and exhausted in the atmosphere with the combustion gases. Further investigation as to the continuous phase composition resulted from evaporating the water from the liquid of the filtration showed in FTIR spectra that part of the surface active agent bonded with the water and passed through the filter paper. Using FTIR method of investigation, a flocculation process noticed in tap water from domestic city supply in Ploiesti, Romania proved to be caused by sodium aluminate (NaAlO2, Na2O center dot Al2O3, or Na2Al2O4, and for this specific case as hydrated form NaAl(OH)(4)). The source could be either excessive use of aluminate for water treatments, i.e. separation of colloids from water, or a hazardous contamination with waters used in constructions. The flakes studied with FTIR spectroscopy, proved to be of the same or similar composition as for the continuous phase of soot composite, and that is the evidence of the transport, and infiltration to the groundwater of soot components. That is the evidence of extended effects of pollution with soot that starts from the air and returns to the ground, harming the safety of human's health in direct and indirect ways. Both contaminations of water, foaming rain water and flocculation in tap water, respectively proved to have the same source which is the soot resulted from fuel cars combustion.

Influence of rare earth addition in cobalt ferrite thin films obtained by pulsed laser deposition	CERAMICS INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Cobalt ferrite; Rare earth; Thin films; Structural properties; Magnetic hysteresis; Optical bandgap	MAGNETIC-PROPERTIES; MAGNETOOPTICAL PROPERTIES; COFE2O4; SUBSTITUTION; BULK; GD	The influence of rare earth (RE = Dy, Gd, Yb) ion doping on the structural, magnetic and optical properties of cobalt ferrite thin films was studied. CoFe2-xRExO4 (x = 0.01; 0.03; 0.05; 0.1; 0.2; 0.3) films were obtained by pulsed laser deposition on silicon substrates. The X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy results on the bulk materials, which were used as targets during deposition, revealed the formation of residual phases as the concentration of RE dopant was increased. However, the annealed thin films presented diffraction lines and vibrational modes corresponding only to cobalt ferrite. A lower crystallinity of the deposited samples was observed when higher RE concentrations were used. Due to the substitution of Fe by RE elements which possess large ionic radii, the lattice parameter of the thin films presented a monotonous increase. The magnetic response of the nanostructures was correlated to the magnetic moment of the RE dopant and to the structural properties of the films. The optical bandgaps derived from the reflectance spectra presented an increasing trend as the Yb and Dy concentrations were augmented.

Space and time resolved optical emission spectroscopy was implemented to analyze the plasma generated by the laser-geomaterial interaction. The values of the plasma parameters (velocity and temperature) were discussed with respect to the nature of the minerals composing the geomaterials and the morphological structure of the samples. Correlations were found between the excitation temperatures of the atomic and ionic species of the plasmas and the presence of calcite in the samples. A mathematical model was built to describe the dynamics in ablation plasma using various mathematical operational procedures: multi structuring of the ablation plasma by means of the fractal analysis and synchronizations of the ablation plasma entities through SL (2R) type group invariance and in a particular case, through self-modulation in the form of Stoler type transformations. Since Stoler type transformations are implied in general, in the charge creation and annihilation processes, then the SL (2R) type group invariance become fundamental in the description of ablation plasma dynamics.

J	Irimiciuc, SA; Gurlui, S; Agop, M				Irimiciuc, Stefan Andrei; Gurlui, Silviu; Agop, Maricel			Particle distribution in transient plasmas generated by ns-laser ablation on ternary metallic alloys	APPLIED PHYSICS B-LASERS AND OPTICS			English	Article							LIBS	Understanding the fundamental mechanisms behind industrial laser-based technologies represents one the cornerstones of the development and tailoring of new materials. With the thin-film deposition using laser ablation being one of the most important techniques for obtaining complex materials with controllable stoichiometry, there is a high request for both experimental and theoretical studies towards understanding the behavior of multi-component alloys under high-power laser irradiation. Here we investigate the laser ablation process on two ternary metallic alloys (Cu-Mn-Al and Fe-Mn-Si) by means of space-and time-resolved optical emission spectroscopy and fast camera imaging with the focus being on the spatial distribution of each composing element. Information regarding the kinetic and thermal energy of the ejected particles is extracted and discussed in the framework of an inner structuring of the laser-produced plasmas based on a mass and energy distribution. The hypothesis is then verified by implementing a fractal analysis to the multi-component plasmas. The theoretical fractal approach offers results in good agreement with the experimental data gives important insight in the inner dynamics of complex laser-produced plasmas.

Medical applications	APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE			English	Article						Keratin; Horn; Wool fiber; Composite; PLD; Sorption; Hemp	INDUCED FLUORESCENCE; VAPOR-DEPOSITION; WOOL	A new method to produce keratin thin films using Pulsed Laser Deposition (PLD) is studied herein in order to obtain composite materials with application for medical purposes while being investigated alpha-keratin physicochemical behavior during compared procedures. The novelty of the method consists in using direct wool fibers and horn bulk as targets, irradiated with a 10 ns pulsed laser, 532 nm wavelengths, 25 J/cm(2) and 37 J/cm(2) fluence, for ablation followed by deposition on different substrates (glass and hemp fabric). This method has the advantage that eliminates preparatory steps, extracting the keratin directly from the raw material. It provides a "two faces" composite material with different sorption properties, enhanced for the face with keratin film. Thin films were analyzed compared to raw materials - wool and horn - as well as materials produced by two alkaline dissolution methods of the wool. Thus, the FTIR analysis revealed changes in the chemical structure of the films compared to that of the wool and horn used as targets due to the breakage of the disulfide bonds and the hydrogen bonding, as well as the breaking of the O = C-O bonds. This indicates a decrease in the length of the polypeptide chains from wool and from horn to pulsed laser deposited keratin. The most of the aforementioned bonds changes appear to occur during pulsed laser deposition from wool, while the chemical structures of the films produced by PLD are very close to that of keratin from the horn, as evidenced in the FTIR analysis. The main property of the keratin to absorb water proves to be preserved in the thin films too, and same the optical properties of transmittance and absorbance. The method is applicable for medicine purposes.

In this paper, we use a fiber optic probe to determine directly in real time and in aqueous medium, the chemical nature of the various constituent compounds nanoparticles produced during Femto-Second Liquid-Phase Laser Ablation. Also, a simple and accurate infrared turbidimeter has been installed judiciously for monitoring by nephelometry and turbidimetry, the concentration of nanoparticles generated in the medium by pulsed laser ablation. A specialized software was developed to supervise by data acquisition the Infrared turbidimeter, both designed and built in-house. For a moderated energy of the incident pulsed laser beam on the metal target of iron and copper, it was possible to determine, by the optical fiber probe and a spectrophotometer, the peaks of the various compounds constituting each metal. The concentration of produced nanoparticles was found tobe linear with time, meaning that the production of nanoparticles by Pulse Laser Ablation is a controllable and precise process. Spectrophotometry can easily be associated with nephelometry and turbidimetry to ensure best monitoring of the production of nanoparticles by laser ablation method.	[Tchami, Jean Hilaire; Kayem, G.

Oscillatory regimes of Langmuir probe current in femtosecond laser-produced plasmas: Experimental and theoretical investigations	APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE			English	Article						Oscillatory regimes; Langmuir probe; Femtosecond laser ablation; Laser-produced plasmas; Fractal model; Fractional quantum Hall effect	CONTINUED FRACTIONS; PLUME PROPAGATION; ABLATION; DYNAMICS; EMISSION; EXPANSION; BEHAVIOR; VACUUM; METALS	We investigate the oscillatory regimes of the Langmuir probe current recorded for the electrical characterization of femtosecond laser-produced plasma. The influence of metallic target biasing, which can perturb the ambipolar electric field generated through the charge separation at early stages of the expansion, is also studied. Two distinct behaviors are evidenced, and they point to the existence of two plasma structures: a fast one consisting in promptly ejected highly charged particles, and a slow "tail" of thermalized particles. Theoretically, a non-differentiable model which involves two scale resolutions is developed. Assuming the principle of scale resolution superposition, the current density at global scale is expressed as the sum of the current density at Coulomb and the thermal scale resolutions, in agreement with the experimental data. Interestingly, the theoretical estimation of oscillation frequencies shows a correspondence with the filling factor hierarchy in the fractional quantum Hall effect.

The thickness of the samples was influenced by the Nd-YAG laser wavelength, fluence, target-to-substrate distance, and deposition time. The topography and chemical analysis results showed that the films deposited by ns-PLD revealed droplets on the surface together with a decreased Te concentration and Sb over-stoichiometry. Thin films with improved surface roughness and chemical compositions close to nominal values were deposited by ps- and fs-PLD. The X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy results showed that the samples obtained with ns pulses were partially crystallized while the lower fluences used in ps- and fs-PLD led to amorphous depositions. The optical parameters of the ns-PLD samples were correlated to their structural properties.

Because of their usually spherical form, such structures are called fireballs. If they appear inside hollow grids, they are called inverted fireballs or plasma bubbles. The temporal evolution of such structures is often accompanied by strong plasma instabilities. The dynamics of complex space-charge structures have been investigated by using single spherical grid cathode with an orifice. Langmuir probe and optical emission spectroscopy were used to diagnose the structures. Measurements delivered the axial profiles of the plasma potential, electron temperature and density, and the densities of excited atoms and ions, that confirmed the formation of a fireball in the region near the orifice (also evidenced by visual observation). Inside the grid, a plasma bubble has developed, with a high ion density inside due to the hollow cathode effect. Information on the nonlinear dynamics of the complex space charge structures was obtained from the analysis of the oscillations of the discharge current.

A non-differential mathematical model was used to build the set of equation to characterize a complex fluid, assimilated with the laser produced plasmas in the fractal paradigm. Numerical simulations regarding the flow of a fractal fluid were performed reflecting real multi-component plasmas. These revealed that the structuring of a fluid is strongly related to its fractality and thus to individual properties of its components. The theoretical results were confronted with experimental data regarding the flow of multi-component plasma in a fluid representation. The laser produced plasma was investigated by means of ICCD fast camera imaging and optical emission spectroscopy. The experimental results showcase a splitting process on the two main directions coupled with a separation of the ejected particles with respect to their excitation energy.

Daily data from 4 monitoring stations of Environmental Protection Agency-Iasi-for main weather parameters and particulate matters - and the temperature from an inner temperature and relative humidity observation network inside the city were used for a three year study (2013-2015). Linear correlation, composite analysis and multiple regression are the main statistical methods applied in the analysis. In brief, the most important meteorological parameters enhancing air pollution in Iasi seem to be represented by thermal inversions developing in the region strongly related to local climate conditions. The Pearson correlation coefficient (stronger than -0.40) between PM10 and thermal gradient, the difference in the PM10 concentration exceeding 20 mu g/m(3) between strong thermal inversions and unstable conditions and the leading role of thermal gradients in multiple regression are the main indicators of the great role of thermal inversion in generating and sustaining pollution conditions in this area. The maximum concentrations of PM10 occur in May and March, gathering more than 30% of the days for the entire year. Complementary studies were taken into account in order to analyse the aerosol optical properties retrieved from Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET-NASA).

Influence of laser-produced plasma parameters on the deposition process: in situ space- and time-resolved optical emission spectroscopy and fractal modeling approach	APPLIED PHYSICS A-MATERIALS SCIENCE & PROCESSING			English	Article							LIGHT-EMITTING-DIODES; ABLATION PLUMES; DYNAMICS; METALS; TARGET	The formation and dynamics of Al and Ag-Ni-Fe plasmas were studied through ICCD imaging and space- and time-resolved optical emission spectroscopy techniques. The experiments were conducted in pulsed laser deposition configuration and the surface topography and chemical composition of the obtained thin films were analyzed. For both targets, a splitting of the plasma plume was observed. Two structures with distinct velocities were analyzed and associated with different types of species: the ions were found predominantly in the fast structure while the excited species were observed mainly in the slow structure. Their different velocities were correlated to the different ejection mechanisms which lead to plasma formation. The angular distributions of the plasma front velocity were analyzed and associated with the mass of the main elements found in the plume. The excitation temperature determined for excited species presented a more uniform distribution than the one calculated for ions using the Boltzmann plot. The experimental results were described by a non-differential theoretical model which took into account the scattering probability, collision frequency and the fractality of the plasmas.

Atmosphere self-cleaning under humidity conditions and influence of the snowflakes and artificial light interaction for water dissociation simulated by the means of COMSOL	APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE			English	Article						Atmosphere spectroscopy; Time-resolved RAMAN and breakdown; Spectroscopy; LIDAR; COMSOL multiphysics; Toxic trace chemical compounds	STOCHEM-CRI; TROPOSPHERE; BUDGET; MODEL; VARIABILITY; CHEMISTRY; DIOXINS; FURANS; HCN	The self-cleaning of the atmosphere under humidity conditions is observed due to the change in emission intensity when chemical traces are investigated with DARLIOES - the advanced LIDAR based on space- and time-resolved RAMAN and breakdown spectroscopy in conditions of consistent humidity of atmosphere. The determination was performed during the night, in the wintertime under conditions of high humidity and snowfall, in urban area of Iasi. The change in chemical composition of the atmosphere detected was assumed to different chemical reactions involving presence of the water. Water dissociation that was registered during spectral measurements is explained by a simulation of the interaction between artificial light and snowflakes - virtually designed in a spherical geometry - in a wet air environment, using COMSOL Multiphysics software. The aim of the study is to explain the decrease or elimination of some of the toxic trace chemical compounds in the process of self-cleaning in other conditions than the sun light interaction for further finding application for air cleaning under artificial conditions.

Electric and optical properties of some new functional lower-rim-substituted calixarene derivatives in thin films	APPLIED PHYSICS A-MATERIALS SCIENCE & PROCESSING			English	Article							CHARGE-TRANSPORT; ORGANIC SEMICONDUCTORS; HETEROCYCLIC-COMPOUNDS; CONDUCTION MECHANISM; HUMIDITY SENSITIVITY; YLIDES; WATER	Electric (d.c. conduction mechanism, the influence of environmental humidity, thermistor effect) and optical properties of new five substituted calixarene derivatives in thin films have been studied. The films behave as typical n-type polycrystalline semiconductors with activation energy of the electric conduction between 0.26 and 2.36 eV. In the higher temperature range, the electron transport was explained in the frame of the band gap representation model, while at lower temperatures, the Mott's variable-range hopping conduction model was found as appropriate. In terms of electric conductivity, these compounds are practically insensitive to ambient humidity below 53% RH, their sensitivity increasing greatly with the humidity in the range of 53-98% RH. Study of optical absorption spectra in the photon energy range of 0.71-4.03 eV (UV-Vis-NIR) revealed direct optical band gaps between 2.64 and 3.83 eV. Actual compounds show promising potential for thermistor applications.

STRUCTURAL, MAGNETIC AND HUMIDITY SENSING PROPERTIES OF RARE EARTH DOPED COBALT FERRITE THIN FILMS SYNTHESIZED BY PULSED LASER DEPOSITION	JOURNAL OF OVONIC RESEARCH			English	Article						Cobalt ferrite; Pulsed laser deposition; Thin films; Humidity sensors	SOL-GEL SYNTHESIS; ELECTRICAL-PROPERTIES; DIELECTRIC-PROPERTIES; NANOCRYSTALLINE FILMS; SPINEL FERRITES; NANOPARTICLES; COFE2O4; SENSORS; GD; FABRICATION	Ferrites are interesting magnetic materials with a wide applicability in current and emerging technologies. CoFe2O4 presents a high magnetostrictive response, important electrical resistivity, mechanical hardness and chemical stability making this material a suitable alternative for the development of sensors, actuators and magneto-optic devices. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of deposition conditions and rare earth substitution on the structural, magnetic and humidity sensing properties of cobalt ferrite thin films obtained by Pulsed Laser Deposition in vacuum. Preliminary results on the film thickness and uniformity were obtained by profilometry and scanning electron microscopy. Vibrational modes corresponding to cobalt ferrite were evidenced through Raman spectroscopy. Energy dispersive X-Ray analysis revealed atomic ratios close to stoichiometric ones and a uniform surface distribution of the main elements. Hysteresis loops obtained by vibrating sample magnetometry in parallel and perpendicular configurations showed no preferential magnetic ordering. Electrical resistance measurements in different relative humidity conditions (RH 0-100%) and frequencies were done using a High Frequency LCR Meter. The doped films presented a decreased electrical resistance and a lower sensitivity compared to the pure ones. This result was correlated with the structural modifications induced by the substitution of iron cations with rare earth ions.

As is known, permanent exposure to the atmosphere in the urban environment causes degradation processes on the surfaces of natural stone monuments, especially on porous stone surfaces. In these investigations were used samples of porous calcareous rocks similar to the natural stone from the many historical monuments of the Iasi city - Romania. These samples were coating with various commercially hydrophobic solutions. Further, these samples were exposed in the immediate vicinity of a historical monument and an intense road traffic junction. After about six months of exposure, apparent changes in the treated surfaces were compared with untreated control surfaces but subjected to the same environmental conditions over the same time period in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the hydrophobic treatment.

The process of laser cleaning treatment of the crust is simulated using COMSOL Multiphysics 4.4, finite element analysis software. Scanning Electron Microscopy coupled with Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy and Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy techniques have been used to analyze the chemical composition of the samples. Two elements found as being present into the dust and in the crust, such as iron and magnesium particles are used for simulation in COMSOL. Therefore, the profiles heat evolutions on the crust surface and inside limestone are obtained as thermal interactions between the three components (iron, magnesium and limestone), simulating the non-homogeneous materials. It has been observed that iron impurities caused by the dust deposition may damage the limestone through a process of overheating, as a consequence of a high thermal conduction phenomenon, recorded for the region with iron impurities and sizes of micrometric order are localized. The thermal contact between the three components results in plots that reflect their thermal interactions. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Plume splitting and oscillatory behavior in transient plasmas generated by high-fluence laser ablation in vacuum	APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE			English	Article						Laser ablation; Transient plasma dynamics; Plasma oscillations; Langmuir probe; Optical emission spectroscopy; Plasma simulation	TIME-OF-FLIGHT; HALL-EFFECT THRUSTER; PROMPT ELECTRONS; EMISSION-SPECTROSCOPY; CHARGE SEPARATION; ION EMISSION; DOUBLE-LAYER; AMBIENT GAS; DYNAMICS; SPACE	We present a short overview of studies performed in our research groups over the last decade on the characterization of transient plasma plumes generated by laser ablation in various temporal regimes, from nanosecond to femtosecond. New results are also presented along with this overview, both being placed in the context of similar studies performed by other investigators. Optical (fast gate intensified CCD camera imaging and space- and time-resolved emission spectroscopy) and electrical (mainly Langmuir probe) methods have been applied to experimentally explore the dynamics of the plasma plume and its constituents. Peculiar effects as plume splitting and sharpening or oscillations onset have been evidenced in vacuum at high laser fluence. New theoretical approaches have been developed to account for the experimental observations. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Laser ablation of (GeSe2)100-x(Sb2Se3)x chalcogenide glasses: Influence of the target composition on the plasma plume dynamics	APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE			English	Article						Chalcogenide; Composition variation; Laser ablation; Plasma dynamics; Optical emission spectroscopy	S-SE GLASSES; OPTICAL-PROPERTIES; DEPOSITION; PHOTOSENSITIVITY; ABSORPTION; GENERATION; FILMS	The dynamics and properties of the (GeSe2)(100-x)(Sh(2)Se(3))x laser-induced plasma were investigated by fast ICCD imaging and space- and time-resolved optical emission spectroscopy (OES). The experiments were performed at 10(-6) Torr background pressure, using the second harmonic (532 nm) of the Nd-YAG laser (10 ns, 10Hz). For all investigated samples, the ICCD images revealed a splitting of the plasma plume into three components with distinct dynamics. Based on OES measurements, the first and second plasma structures were found to be represented mainly by ionic and neutral species, respectively. As the Sb2Se3 content of the samples increases, the three structures present an increase in their velocities. This dynamic variation and also the compositional, dependence of the excitation temperature obtained from Boltzmann plots were correlated to the changes in the structure and electrical/thermal properties of the bulk chalcogenide glasses.

Investigation of femtosecond laser-produced plasma from various metallic targets using the Langmuir probe characteristic	PHYSICS OF PLASMAS			English	Article							ABLATION; EXPANSION; EMISSION	The Langmuir probe is used to characterize the plasma produced by fs-laser ablation from pure metallic targets. Time dependence of the probe current and the total collected charge is discussed in terms of a shifted Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution function, and from probe characteristics the plasma temperature and average charge state are calculated. Target materials of various physical properties (atomic mass, thermal constants) are used to find possible correlations with resulting plasma parameters. By positively biasing the probe, the collected charge - probe voltage characteristic is in general vertically shifted, and for low negative probe potentials an effect consisting in an abnormal decrease of the ion current is observed. Periodic falls of the total collected charge vs. probe voltage are experimentally recorded, the effect being more significant at high background pressure. They are tentatively attributed to secondary ionization. Published by AIP Publishing.

Langmuir probe investigation of transient plasmas generated by femtosecond laser ablation of several metals: Influence of the target physical properties on the plume dynamics	APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE			English	Article						Langmuir probe; Laser produced plasma; Femtosecond laser ablation; Shifted Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution; Electrical conductivity	NANOSECOND; DEPOSITION; VAPORIZATION; THRESHOLDS; VACUUM	Langmuir probe measurements were performed on transient plasmas generated by femtosecond laser ablation of several metallic targets (Al, Cu, Mn, Ni, In, Te, W). The analysis of current-voltage characteristics at various delays after the laser pulse gave access to the temporal evolution of ion density, electron temperature and plasma potential. The time-of-flight profile of the current recorded by the probe was also discussed in terms of a shifted Maxwell-Boltzmann velocity distribution, considering both thermal and drift velocities. The plasma parameters derived by these approaches were correlated with the electrical conductivity of the investigated metals. Assuming a direct dependence between the probe ionic signal and the charge carrier mobility in the target, a logarithmic fit was proposed for the plasma potential variation with electrical conductivity, whereas a derivative of this function was applied for the electron temperature. The saturation charge derived from the time-integrated probe ionic signals was influenced by the electrical conductivity of the target and also by the atomic weight of the metal. A steep increase of the thermal and drift velocities with conductivity was observed. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Irimiciuc, S.

As in many other urban areas, in Iasi city the traffic is one of the main sources of air pollution which has a high environmental impact, also exposing population's health to a high risk. The study focuses on the small scale examining the spatial and temporal variability of air pollution in a very important and frequently circulated crossroad, Podu de Piatra. Using various data from air pollution monitoring stations and local meteorological data, both, measurements and field observations, the study assesses the relation between traffic intensity, the presence of pollutants and the exposure of vulnerable population in an area that is one of the hot-spots of air pollution in Iasi. The objective is to apply a spatial exposure assessment model which combines proximity-based and dispersion models in order to estimate the overall impact of transport on air pollution. The GIS allows to incorporate spatial data, manage it, analyse it, and answer spatial questions. The major outcomes of this study are: the air circulation contributes to the increase of relative pollutant concentration on different sides of the streets; monitoring stations has difficulties to estimate with precision the wind speed variation; the lowest estimation of NOx have been obtained along the street in 19th April at 6 AM when the wind is perpendicular to the street axis, while the highest was record on 20th April at 18 PM when the wind is parallel to the street axis; to help assessing the representativeness of data from national air quality system.

Photodimer products were formed via UV irradiation. Syn head-tohead and syn head-to-tail photodimers were formed under one-photon (broadband UV) irradiation in polar solvents. The spectral investigation of the photochemical products of PUC revealed efficient fluorescence emission in the spectral region 300-400 nm, attributed to the syn-head-to-tail dimers of PUC. The results show that under irradiation of lambda > 310 nm photodimerization process are increased and under UV irradiation with lambda < 260 nm, photocleavage degree have been evidenced, too. Fluorescence spectra analysis of PUC in polar and film-based solvents reveals another very important result. The 375 nm fluorescence wavelength of the PUC (exciting beam 310 nm) is about 30 times more intense than the same maximum in THF and in DMF. This result indicates a new method to confirm that PUC film photodimerisation occurs especially at its surface.

The aim of the paper is to highlight the impact of pollution on the surface structures of some porous carbonate rocks, where a series of radionucides and heavy metals have been identified. Taking into account that these rocks are considered as commonly used local building material, being utilized also for the construction of the medieval and pre-modern historical monuments from the city of Iasi, the study draws attention to the detailed assessment of their conservation status from the built heritage in relation to the surrounding environment.

Spectral and electrical diagnosis of complex space-charge structures excited by a spherical grid cathode with orifice	PHYSICA SCRIPTA			English	Article						complex space charge structure; plasma fireball; plasma diagnosis; electron temperature; oscillations		Optical emission spectroscopy and Langmuir probes were used to diagnose complex space-charge structures that appear inside and around a spherical grid with orifice applying a negative voltage below a critical value to it. Measurements (through the orifice) delivered the axial profiles of plasma potential, electron temperature and density, and of the densities of excited atoms and ions. Thereby the formation of a double layer was found in the region near the orifice with a potential drop close to the ionisation potential of the applied gas, confirming the presence of a fireball in that region (also evidenced by visual observation), i.e. of a quasi-spherical bright plasma region consisting of a positive core (an ion-rich plasma) confined by a double layer. Spectral investigations confirmed the presence of high ion density inside the spherical grid (due to the hollow cathode effect), while outside the grid a transition region with a strong rate of ionisation and excitation processes appears. Information on the nonlinear dynamics of this space-charge structure was obtained from the analysis of the oscillations of the discharge current, as well as of the floating potential inside and outside the spherical grid.

A compact non-differential approach for modeling laser ablation plasma dynamics	JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS			English	Article							LANGMUIR PROBE; EXPANSION; MECHANISMS; VACUUM; MASS	Various differentiable physical models are frequently used to describe the dynamics of laser-produced plasma plumes (e.g., kinetic models, two-fluid models, etc.). Given the complexity of all the phenomena involved in the laser-matter interactions, it is required to introduce the laser ablation plasma dynamic variable dependencies both on the space-time coordinates and on the resolution scales. Therefore, an adequate theoretical approach may be the use of non-differentiable physical models (fractal models). Continuing our previous work on the fractal hydrodynamic model for laser ablation plasma dynamics, we propose here a compact version for the analysis of the spatial and temporal evolution of some plasma dynamic variables, such as velocities, currents, number densities, or temperatures. Moreover, the influence of external factors on the ablation plasma dynamics is considered. The predictions of this model are compared with the experimental data obtained by using a Langmuir probe on an Aluminum laser-produced plasma.	[Irimiciuc, S.

Approaching on Colorimetric Change of Porous Calcareous Rocks Exposed in Urban Environmental Conditions from Iasi - Romania	INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INNOVATIVE RESEARCH - ICIR EUROINVENT 2017	IOP Conference Series-Materials Science and Engineering		English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Innovative Research (ICIR Euroinvent)	MAY 25-26, 2017	Iasi, ROMANIA	Romanian Inventors Forum, Gheorghe Asachi Tech Univ Iasi, Fac Mat Sci & Engn, Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ Iasi, ARHEOINVEST Platform, Univ Malaysia Perlis, Ctr Excellence Geopolymer & Green Technol, Malaysian Res & Innovat Soc, EUROINVENT			STONE MONUMENTS	According to the scientific literature, the pollution phenomenon is strongly related by the urban activity from the last decades, with direct effects on the state of conservation of the stone constructions also. This paper presents a preliminary study on the colorimetric evolution of the lithic surfaces exposed under strongly traffic influence from the urban microclimate conditions. The analysed lithic surfaces are similar with the building stone from the structure of an historical monument (from 19 th century), such as the Stone Bridge in Iasi Romania, located in the immediate vicinity of the roadside loop with the same name. The colour change monitoring for the above-mentioned geomaterials aims at anticipating the effects of postponing the decongestion of car traffic and implicitly initiating the assessment of the effects of pollution over this historic monument, which is in an advanced state of deterioration and degradation.

The absorption edge of submicrometric ZnO films on quartz is determined by direct transitions corresponding to an optical band gap of 3.88 eV, at 300 K. For ZnO films with thickness between 1.5 and 10 gm, the absorption threshold is of excitonic nature. Photoluminescence of polycrystalline ZnO films on amorphous quartz reaches its maximum in the orange spectral range, while that of ZnO films on oriented single crystalline GaSe substrate covers the entire visible range.

The investigated compounds are polycrystalline (as shown by X-ray Diffraction analysis) and showtypical n-type semiconductor behavior. The activation energy of d.c. electric conduction ranges between 1.55 and 2.33 eV. Some correlations between semiconducting characteristics and essential features of molecular structure of organic compounds have been established. In the higher temperature range (400-520 K), the electronic transport properties in present compounds can be explained in the frame of band gap representation model, while in the lower temperature range (300-350 K), the Mott's variable-range hopping conduction model can be conveniently used.

The materials in question have been utilized in the construction of two historic monuments. Throughout the evaluation proceedings regarding the state of conservation of the monuments in question, a number of porous surfaces were identified, such as calcareous rock and ornamental terracotta. The aim of the article is to evaluate the hydrophobic degree obtained by applying certain pellicles, in keeping with the modern principles of scientific conservation. During the experiments, an array of different commercially available hydrophobic additives was used. The tests were performed in laboratory conditions, with the purpose of presenting the chromatic interaction between surface and product. The main techniques used for the analysis during the experiments were: CIE L* a* b*, OM and exposure to UV radiation in laboratory conditions. The results obtained are analyzed and discussed, with the purpose of evaluating the efficiency of hydrophobic solutions, taking into consideration the chromatic deviation, as compared to exposure to UV radiation.

MAGNETIC NANOPARTICLES GENERATED BY LASER ABLATION IN LIQUID	DIGEST JOURNAL OF NANOMATERIALS AND BIOSTRUCTURES			English	Article						nanoparticles; laser ablation; polyethylene glycol; TEM images	SUBSTITUTED COBALT FERRITE; IRON-OXIDE NANOPARTICLES; OPTICAL-PROPERTIES; FABRICATION; PHASE; COMPOSITE; REMOVAL	We report on the generation of magnetic nanoparticles by nanosecond laser ablation of cobalt ferrite in liquid. We investigated the influence of both ablation liquid (water, ethanol, polyethylene glycol in water) and irradiation conditions (laser energy/pulse and spot size) on the nanoparticles dimension, shape, structure, chemical composition and magnetic properties. A single phase cobalt ferrite target was immersed in various solutions and irradiated with an Nd-YAG laser at fluences varying from 4 to 12 J/cm(2). A first characterization of the so generated colloidal solution was performed by UV-VIS absorption spectroscopy. Then, the samples were dried at 80 degrees C and the resulting material was collected for further investigations. The structural and chemical properties were studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM/EDX). The nanoparticles magnetic response was recorded using a vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM). TEM micrographs revealed that the particle diameter and size distribution varied as the laser energy and irradiation spot area were modified or when polymer surfactant was added to the ablation liquid. The broad absorption band observed for all analyzed solutions was considered to be a superposition of multiple peaks associated to iron oxides. EDX measurements revealed an overstoichiometry of iron for most samples. VSM results confirmed the ferromagnetic character of the nanoparticles and their magnetic parameters were correlated to their size and chemical composition.

The intrusion of Saharan dust above the monitoring site [Iasi_LOASL, Romania (47.19N, 27.55E)] and the variations of ozone and NO2 concentrations are estimated by using advanced remote sensing techniques (i.e. Aerosol Robotic NETwork - AERONET, Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations - CALIPSO) and forecast models (i.e. DREAM and MAP 3D). The time interval was appropriately selected, to remove the influence of precipitation and clouds on photochemical processes. During intrusion events, the Saharan dust represents the main source for changes in optical and chemical parameters of the atmosphere.	[Cazacu, M. M.; Tudose, O.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and linear potentiodynamic polarization (LPP) techniques were used for the study of the electrochemical behavior of uncoated FeMnSi and coated FeMnSi with hydroxyapatite + zirconia (HA-ZrO2) through pulsed laser deposition (PLD) technique. Experiments were carried out using Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS). It has been shown that in HBSS the impedance for uncoated FeMnSi was mainly characterized by one capacitive effect, which related to the alloy charge transfer control. The charge transfer resistance increases for HA-ZrO2-coated FeMnSi alloy. The equivalent circuits simulating the electrochemical behavior of both uncoated and HA-ZrO2-coated FeMnSi alloys in HBSS were proposed. From LPP the corrosion resistance was evaluated by means of the zero current potential (ZCP) and corrosion current density (j(corr)). The surface morphology of both uncoated and HA-coated FeMnSi alloys in HBSS obtained after LPP was studied using scanning electron microscopy (SEM).

The present paper presents a method that evaluates the hydrophobization efficiency of two types of pellicles, involving UV artificial ageing and colorimetric analysis of the treated surfaces. The evaluation was done through continuous colorimetric monitoring and by comparing the evolution of the chromatic modifications of the two treated surfaces with the original colorimetric values and with the witness area, which was exposed to UV radiations under the same conditions, but left chemical untreated. The techniques used during this experiment were: CIE L*a*b*colorimetry, OM, SEM-EDX, UV radiation exposure and Spectrum Irradiance Measurement.	[Pelin, V.; Munteanu, M.; Iurcovschi, C.

Because volcanic ash represents one of the most serious natural hazards that could affect aviation safety, the measurement campaign was focused on improving the reaction of relevant authorities in case of airspace contamination with volcanic ash and, particularly, to assess the current operational procedures and information flows. Organized in the frame of the International Civil Aviation Organization - EUR/NAT Office in Paris, the VOLCEX measurements in Romania were coordinated by the Romanian Atmospheric 3D research Observatory (RADO) and Romanian Air Traffic Services (ROMATSA). The results from lidar measurements from Bucharest, Iasi, Cluj-Napoca-Napoca and Timisoara are presented, emphasizing the dynamics of the aerosol layers and the estimation of particle mass concentrations in the free troposphere.

Effect of rare earth substitution in cobalt ferrite bulk materials	JOURNAL OF MAGNETISM AND MAGNETIC MATERIALS			English	Article						Cobalt ferrite; Rate earth substitution; Mossbatter spectroscopy; Magnetostriction	MAGNETIC-PROPERTIES; MAGNETOCRYSTALLINE ANISOTROPY; DIELECTRIC-PROPERTIES; NANOCRYSTALLINE; GD; COFE2O4; RE; EU; ND; LA	The study was focused on the influence of small amounts of rare earth (RE=La, Ce, Sm, Gd, Dy, Ho, Er, Yb) addition on the microstructure, phase content and magnetic properties of cobalt ferrite bulk materials. The X-Ray diffraction measurements confirmed the formation of the spinel structure but also the presence of secondary phases of RE oxides or orthoferrite in small percentages (up to 3%). Density measurements obtained by Archimedes method revealed a similar to 1 g cm(-3) decrease for the RE doped cobalt ferrite samples compared with stoichiometric one. Both the Mossbauer and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrocopy analysis results confirmed the formation of the spinet phase. The saturation magnetization and coercive field values of the doped samples obtained by Vibrating Sample Magnetometry were close to those of the pure cobalt ferrite. For magnetostrictive property studies the samples were analyzed using the strain gauge method. Higher maximum magnetostriction coefficients were found for the Ho, Ce, Sm and Yb doped cobalt ferrite bulk materials as related to the stoichiometric CoFe2O4 sample. Moreover, improved strain derivative was observed for these samples but at higher magnetic fields due to the low increase of the coercive field values for doped samples. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

PURE AND RARE EARTH DOPED COBALT FERRITE LASER ABLATION: SPACE AND TIME RESOLVED OPTICAL EMISSION SPECTROSCOPY	DIGEST JOURNAL OF NANOMATERIALS AND BIOSTRUCTURES			English	Article						Cobalt ferrite; Rare earth; Laser ablation; Plasma dynamics; Excitation temperature	MAGNETIC-PROPERTIES; DEPOSITION; DYNAMICS	Cobalt ferrite thin films with preferential crystallographic structure, controlled composition and perpendicular magnetic anisotropy can be obtained by pulsed laser deposition. Their properties are influenced by the experimental conditions and thus by the deposition plasma plume characteristics. The aim of this study was to obtain information on the dynamics of the expanding plasma generated by laser irradiation (532nm, 10 ns, 10Hz) of three bulk materials of pure and rare-earth doped (RE=Dy, Gd) cobalt ferrite. This was done through space-and time-resolved optical emission spectroscopy using an ICCD camera and a monochromator. Both the global dynamics of the plasma and the evolution of individual species were analyzed. From the space-and time-evolution of several spectral lines, we determined the velocities of the main plasma plume constituents. The excitation temperature spatial distribution was obtained from the Boltzmann plot of four spectral lines, in the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium.	[Bulai, G.; Gurlui, S.; Caltun, O.

Advanced metallic materials response at laser excitation for medical applications	JOURNAL OF OPTOELECTRONICS AND ADVANCED MATERIALS			English	Article						Biocompatible alloy; Laser; Hydroxyapatite; SEM; EDAX	HYDROXYAPATITE; ALLOY; BIOCOMPATIBILITY; SURFACE; ACID	To realize satisfactory fixation of hydroxyapatite (HA) and bio-functionality of bio-tolerated and bio-inert materials such as Ti6Al4V few physical surface modifications such as threaded surface through laser interactions have been produced to promote lung tissue and bone growth on a metallic material. Laser interaction with surface purposes are based on cleaning surface contaminants, roughening surfaces to increase effective surface area and producing beneficial surface compressive residual stress, depending on the laser exposure conditions and as a result, such treated surfaces exhibit a higher surface energy. The layers chemical and physical properties were determined using micro-indenter equipment (type CETR-UMT, Bruker), SEM (type VegaTescan LMHII) with 2 and 3 D insights and EDAX (type Bruker with PB ZAF quantification method).

Study of planetary boundary layer height from LIDAR measurements and ALARO model	JOURNAL OF OPTOELECTRONICS AND ADVANCED MATERIALS			English	Article						PBL height; Lidar; ALARO; Radio-soundings; Microwave radiometer	MULTIWAVELENGTH RAMAN LIDAR; AIRBORNE LIDAR; PARAMETERIZATION; AEROSOLS; GREECE; DEPTH; CLOUD	The time evolution of the Planetary Boundary Layer (PBL) height has a significant impact on weather events and air quality since it is one of the parameters affecting the atmospheric state. This paper presents results concerning the PBL height retrieval using several techniques and assessment methods. The studies are focused on remote sensing methods, radiosoundings and numerical models. The PBL height behaviour has been studied in two sites by means of vertical humidity, temperature profiles and range corrected lidar signal. A good correlation between lidar, microwave radiometry and radio sounding profiles has been evidenced for the analyzed period. PBL height estimation performed by ALARO has a permanent offset with respect to the other methods during the cold season.	[Timofte, A.; Cazacu, M.

Thus, the seasonal trends of aerosols and its external influences have been studied using aerosol optical properties retrieved from Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET). Complementary studies were taken into account by using several meteorological factors, computational models and meteorological data. Moreover, this paper presents optical properties analysis of different types of aerosols and the seasonal variability of them in one year of measurements. The major categories of aerosol types are evidenced, such as urban/industrial aerosol, biomass burning and mineral dust. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Systematic measurements have been carried out on a plasma produced in vacuum by Nd:YAG laser irradiation of a copper target. The temporal evolution of the ionic current for different fluences was investigated, revealing the presence of some periodic oscillations. A theoretical model is proposed in order to describe the nonlinear behavior of the expanding plasma by assuming that the motion curves of the ablated particles are fractals. The behaviors predicted by the proposed theoretical model are in good agreement with the experimental findings.

Pulsed laser deposition of rare-earth-doped gallium lanthanum sulphide chalcogenide glass thin films	APPLIED PHYSICS A-MATERIALS SCIENCE & PROCESSING			English	Article							OPTICAL WAVE-GUIDES; INFRARED-EMISSION; SPECTROSCOPY	Amorphous chalcogenide thin films are of high current interest for technological applications as optical storage media or waveguides for photonic integrated circuits. As part of a larger project including fs, ps and ns pulsed laser deposition regimes, Er- and Pr-doped GLS thin films were deposited by ns PLD, and their structural, chemical and optical properties were analyzed by optical and electronic microscopy, stylus profilometry, X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, variable-angle spectroscopic ellipsometry and optical transmission. Films deposited at moderate fluence (4 J/cm(2)) in UV (266 nm) presented a good surface quality, while exhibiting acceptable composition uniformity and deviations from stoichiometry in line with the literature. Composition and optical properties dependences on the deposition conditions were investigated and discussed with respect to previous studies on similar systems.	[Pompilian, O.

Infrared radiation is energy radiated by the motion of atoms and molecules on the surface of aerosols, when their temperature is more than absolute zero. The IR camera measures directly the intensity of radiation emitted by aerosols which is converted by an imaging sensor into an electric signal, resulting a thermal image. Every image pixel that corresponds to a specific radiance is pre-processed to identify the brightness temperature. The thermal infrared imaging radiometer used in this study, NicAir, is a precision radiometer developed by Prata et al. The device was calibrated for the temperature range of 270-320 K and using a calibration table along with image processing software, important information about variations in temperature can be extracted from acquired IR images. The PBL is the lowest layer of the troposphere where the atmosphere interacts with the ground surfaces. The importance of PBL lies in the fact that it provides a finite but varying volume in which pollutants can disperse. The aim of this paper is to analyze the PBL altitude and thickness variations over Iasi region using the IR imaging camera as well as its behavior from day to night and thermal processes occurring in PBL.

Pulsed Laser Deposition (PLD) is a widely used technique that allows the growth of thin films with complex chemical formula. We present the results obtained for stoichiometric and Gadolinium-doped cobalt ferrite thin films deposited by PLD using a femtosecond laser with 1 kHz repetition rate. The structural properties of the as obtained samples were compared with other thin films deposited by ns-PLD. The structural characteristics and chemical composition of the samples were investigated using profilometry, Raman spectroscopy, X-Ray diffraction measurements and ToF-SIMS analysis. Cobalt ferrite thin films with a single spinel structure and a preferential growth direction have been obtained. The structural analysis results indicated the presence of internal stress for all the studied samples. By fs-PLD, uniform thin films were obtained in a short deposition time. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V.

The dynamics of the plasma between target and substrate was investigated through time-and space-resolved optical emission spectroscopy. High-resolution optical spectra have been recorded in the UV-VIS range using a 500-mm focal length monochromator and a fast gate ICCD camera. From the space-time evolution of the optical signals, the velocities of various species (including neutrals and ions) have been derived. Using the relative intensity method, the space-and time-evolution of the excitation temperature and electronic density have been determined. A complex behavior of the laser ablation plasma has been revealed. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Pompilian, O.

Laser ablation in a running hall effect thruster for space propulsion	APPLIED PHYSICS A-MATERIALS SCIENCE & PROCESSING			English	Article							STATIONARY PLASMA THRUSTERS; WALL	Hall Effect Thrusters (HETs) are promising electric propulsion devices for the station-keeping of geostationary satellites (more than 120 in orbit to date). Moreover, they can offer a cost-effective solution for interplanetary journey, as proved by the recent ESA SMART-1 mission to the Moon. The main limiting factor of the HETs lifetime is the erosion of the annular channel ceramics walls. In order to provide a better understanding of the energy deposition on the insulated walls, a laser irradiation study has been carried out on a PPS100-ML thruster during its run in the PIVOINE-2G ground test facility (CNRS Orl,ans, France). Two distinct approaches have been followed: continuous wave fiber laser irradiation (generation of thermal defects) and nanosecond pulsed laser ablation (generation of topological defects).

In this work, we studied the influence of the Fe3+ ions substitution by three elements from lanthanide group (Dy, La, and Gd) on the structural properties of the thin films. The samples were deposited by Nd:YAG laser (lambda=532 nm, 10 ns) ablation of CoFe1.8RE0.2O4, (RE=Dy, La, Gd) targets at various substrate temperatures ranging from room temperature to 600 A degrees C. The microstructure and chemical composition of the thin films were investigated by Raman spectroscopy, XRD, SEM-EDS, and ToF-SIMS. The XRD patterns and Raman spectra of the thin films indicated the formation of a single spinel structure. Thus, the desired substitution of the iron ions in the spinel lattice with the RE elements was achieved in the thin films, although in the bulk material, their presence determined the formation of a residual phase with a perovskite-type structure.

In order to properly identify and characterize the aerosol types, Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) data and sun-photometer measurements were analysed using parameters such as: optical thickness, spectral dependence of angstrom ngstrom exponent (alpha), spectral dependence of Single Scattering Albedo and the dominating size mode. Several cases to highlight the presence of Saharan dust and biomass were presented, too. An event on the 6th of July, 2012 shows that the LIDAR ratios are between 60 similar to 70 sr, with an angstrom ngstrom exponent between 1.5 similar to 1.8 for urban/industrial aerosol and a LIDAR ratios between 40 similar to 50 sr with an angstrom ngstrom exponent between 1.7 similar to 1.9 for biomass burning. A major presence of urban / industrial dust was evidenced here.

Having the unique shape memory, super-elastic affects and now damping capacity SMAs have become an important smart material for a broad range of engineering applications in last year's. Copper based SMAs are promising alloys, based on the obtaining price and good characteristic properties. Shape memory alloys as thin films are used for fast actuation in applications due to their high surface to volume ratio comparing to bulk SMAs. In this paper two shape memory alloys based on copper, proposed as targets in different deposition processes to obtain MEMS and with different chemical composition, are analyzed through scanning electrons microscope (SEM), XRD and EDAX considerations after water quenching and recovery heat treatments. The martensite variants are dimensioned and 3D aspects are also analyzed for both metallic materials. The metallic phases obtained after heat treatment are determined and compare in both thermal influenced cases.

A double peak structure of the electronic part was experimentally observed, as consequence of the existence of non-Maxwellian electron distribution through the hot and cold electrons. Applying an external voltage on the target, the ionic part becomes oscillatory, with plasma ion frequency. Assuming that particle motions take place on continuous and non-differentiable curves, a fractal hydrodynamic model of plasma expansion is built. In such conjecture, the analytical solutions and numerical simulations allow a reasonable interpretation of our experimental results.

Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy in a running Hall Effect Thruster for space propulsion	SPECTROCHIMICA ACTA PART B-ATOMIC SPECTROSCOPY			English	Article						Electric space propulsion; Hall Effect Thruster; Erosion; Optical emission spectroscopy; Actinomeny	STATIONARY PLASMA THRUSTERS; WALL	Hall Effect Thrusters (HETs) are promising electric propulsion devices for the station-keeping of geostationary satellites and for interplanetary missions. The main limiting factor of the HET lifetime is the erosion of the annular channel ceramic walls. Erosion monitoring has been performed in the laboratory using optical emission spectroscopy (OES) measurements and data treatment based on the coronal model and the actinometric hypothesis. This study uses laser ablation of the ceramic wall in a running HET in order to introduce controlled amounts of sputtered material in the thruster plasma. The transient laser-induced breakdown plasma expands orthogonally in a steady-state plasma jet created by the HET discharge. The proposed spectroscopic method involves species from both plasmas (B, Xe, Xe+). The optical emission signal is correlated to the ablated volume (measured by profilometry) leading to the first direct validation of the actinometric hypothesis in this frame and opening the road for calibration of in-fiight erosion monitoring based on the OES method.

In last year's a new property of this material present interest for researches with applications in all energy dissipation systems. A shape memory alloy based on copper (CuMnAl) was obtained through classical melting method. Material exhibit shape memory effect and damping capacity based on martensitic type transformation. The martensite transformation temperatures change their values with the material state (as cast, heat treated, tensioned) usually from right to the left reaching temperatures around 75-80 degrees C. Samples of copper based shape memory alloy in different solicitation states like as cast, deformed, tensioned with 4, 8 and 12 percentages were analyzed through scanning electrons microscopy (SEM) using different features of Vega Tescan software.

The chaotic atom model via a fractal approximation of motion	PHYSICA SCRIPTA			English	Article							SCALE-RELATIVITY; QUANTUM-THEORY	A new model of the atom is built based on a complete and detailed nonlinear dynamics analysis (complete time series, Poincare sections, complete phase space, Lyapunov exponents, bifurcation diagrams and fractal analysis), through the correlation of the chaotic-stochastic model with a fractal one. Some specific mechanisms that ensure the atom functionality are proposed: gun, chaotic gun and multi-gun effects for the excited states (the classical analogue of quantum absorption) and the fractalization of the trajectories for the stationary states (a natural way of introducing the quantification).

Deposition was made in two different conditions regarding the substrate temperature (room temperature and 400 degrees C heated substrate). The fourth harmonic (lambda = 266 11117) of a 10 ns Nd:YAG pulsed laser beam (Continuum Surelite) has been used. The laser impact spot is elliptical (45 degrees incidence). Studies indicated an effect of heating process on smoothness and compacticity of deposited nanoscale layer. Few layer properties have been investigated by means of a VEGA-TESCAN Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) equipped with the QUANTAX Bruker AXS Microanalysis system.	[Largeanu, Anca; Galusca, D.

Al2O3 ceramics under high-fluence irradiation: plasma plume dynamics through space- and time-resolved optical emission spectroscopy	APPLIED PHYSICS A-MATERIALS SCIENCE & PROCESSING			English	Article							LASER-INDUCED PLASMA; CARBON PLASMA; ABLATION; EXPANSION; TARGET	The dynamics of a transient laser ablation plasma plume has been investigated by means of space- and time-resolved optical emission spectroscopy (OES), through a high-resolution monochromator and a fast gate ICCD camera. The experiments have been carried out with the third harmonic (355 nm) of a Q-switched (10 ns) Nd:YAG laser focused on Al2O3 samples placed in a vacuum chamber (10(-7) Torr). The splitting of the plasma plume into two components has been evidenced by ICCD imaging. In the OES study, Al and O neutral atoms and different charge state ions have been monitored through the evolution of selected spectral lines. The two plume components (fast and slow) are found to consist mainly of charged and neutral species, respectively. Fundamental parameters of these species (e.g. excitation temperature) have been derived.	[Ursu, C.; Pompilian, O.

Oscillatory Langmuir probe ion current in laser-produced plasma expansion	EPL			English	Article							ABLATION; MODEL	Using the Langmuir probe method to investigate the parameters of laser-produced plasma, our experimental results show an oscillatory structure of the recorded transient ion current. The periodic behavior is analyzed for various targets and probe positions and, after extracting the continuous part, it is found to be connected with the ion frequency and the electron-ion collision frequency. We conclude that theories to describe these oscillations may provide new diagnostic techniques of laser-produced plasma.

Implications of an extended fractal hydrodynamic model	EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL D			English	Article							EPSILON((INFINITY)) SPACE-TIME; MULTIPLE DOUBLE-LAYERS; SCALE-RELATIVITY; TRANSITION; DYNAMICS; STRINGS	Considering that the motions of the particles take place on continuous but non-differentiable curves, i.e. on fractals with constant fractal dimension, an extended scale relativity model in its hydrodynamic version is built. In this approach, static (particle in a box and harmonic oscillator) and time-dependent (free particle etc.) systems are analyzed. The static systems can be associated with a coherent fractal fluid (of superconductor or of super-fluid types behavior), whose particles are moving on stationary trajectories. The complex speed field of the fractal fluid proves to be essential: the zero value of the real (differentiable) part specifies the coherence of the fractal fluid, while the non-zero value of the imaginary (non-differentiable or fractal) part selects, through some "quantization" relations, the "stationary" trajectories (that may correspond to the observables from quantum mechanics) of the fractal fluid particles. Moreover, the momentum transfer in the fractal fluid is achieved only through the fractal component of the complex speed field. The free time-dependent systems can be associated with an incoherent fractal fluid, and both the differentiable and fractal components of complex speed field are inhomogeneous in fractal coordinates due to the action of a fractal potential. It exist momentum transfer on both speed components and the "observable" in the form of an uniform motion is generated through a specific mechanism of "vacuum" polarization induced by the same fractal potential.

The experiments carried out were focused on obtaining the polypropylene nonocomposite samples. In all the experiments the polypropylene with flow rate in melt of 9.21g/10min and nanoblend MB1201 were used. The structure analysis of polypropylene nanocomposites was made by means of XRD and FT-IR methods. XRD analysis shows that for nanocomposite based on polypropylene, the exfoliation of organo-bentonites takes place. The results shows a high improvement in the mechanic properties of the NPP4 with 5% and NPP4 with 15% glass fiber nanocomposite compared to the NPP4 nanocomposite.

Fractal Transport Phenomena through the Scale Relativity Model	ACTA PHYSICA POLONICA A			English	Article							EPSILON((INFINITY)) SPACE-TIME; TRANSITION	A correspondence between Nottale's scale relativity model and Cresson's mathematical procedures is analyzed. It results that the "synchronization" of the movements at different scales (fractal scale, differential scale etc.) gives conductive type properties to the fractal fluid, while the absence of "synchronization" is inducing properties of convective type. The behavior of a conductive fractal fluid is illustrated through the numerical simulation of plasma diffusion that is generated by laser ablation. Rotational and irrotational convective behaviors of a fractal fluid are established. Particularly, at Compton spatial and temporal scales, the irrotational behavior implies the standard Schrodinger equation.	[Pompilian, G.

Laser ablation of AsxSe100-x chalcogenide glasses: Plume investigations	APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE			English	Article						Laser ablation; Chalcogenides; Optical emission spectroscopy; Plasma plume dynamics	OPTICAL-PROPERTIES; PLASMA PLUMES; FILMS; DEPOSITION; SPECTRUM	The use of amorphous chalcogenides offers advantages such as remarkable optical properties like a wide transmission window (similar to 1-20 mu m) depending upon composition, making them suitable for sensitive detection of clinical or environmental changes. They also present interesting high (non) linear refractive indices, photorefractive effects, and other properties interesting for wavelength conversion, all-optical switching or modulation, Raman and parametric amplification, laser sources for mid-IR, etc. Slab waveguides based on chalcogenide amorphous films with good adherence and controlled composition can be obtained using pulsed laser deposition allowing to design and to manufacture complex optical functions on waveguides within a small and compact chip. The aim of this work is to characterize the ejection plume obtained by laser ablation of AsxSe100-x samples in order to get some insight on the process involved for optimizing the pulsed laser deposition process. The dynamics of the plume has been systematically investigated by ICCD camera fast imaging and space-and time-resolved optical emission spectroscopy for samples of various compositions.

Systematic measurements have been carried out on plasma produced in vacuum (10(-8) Torr residual pressure) by Nd:YAG laser (10 ns, 532 nm) irradiation of Aluminum targets. Al neutral atoms and different charge state ions have been monitored through the evolution of corresponding spectral lines. The study evidenced the presence of two different groups of particles, tentatively related to two distinct ejection mechanisms. This behavior has been confirmed by the fast ICCD (20 ns gate) recording of the total optical emission of the plume. The application of the relative line intensity method to the study of the excitation temperature axial profile is equally discussed. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Laser -: BNSiO2 Ceramics Interaction:: simulation of the energy deposition on dielectric wall surfaces in Hall thrusters	JOURNAL OF OPTOELECTRONICS AND ADVANCED MATERIALS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Fundamental and Applied Research in Physics	OCT 25-28, 2007	Iasi, ROMANIA			BNSiO2; ceramics; laser interaction; Hall thrusters; simulation	ABLATION; NANOPARTICLES; DESORPTION	The dielectric wall surfaces of the annular chamber which are used in Hall Effect Thrusters (HET) to limit the plasma discharge play an important role but yet completely not understood and controlled. In order to investigate the effect of an energy flux on the wall we performed tests with a nanosecond pulsed laser to simulate the energy deposition on BNSiO2 (usual dielectric material for HETs). The tests have been carried out with the second harmonic (532 nm) of a Q-switched (10 ns) Nd:YAG laser focused on the samples placed in a vacuum chamber (10(-6) Torr). The energy/pulse range explored has been 5 - 320 mJ, leading to fluences of 1 - 1000 J/cm(2). The modifications induced by laser irradiation on the BNSiO2 targets have been analysed by profilometry and scanning electron microscopy. The plasma created by laser ablation has also been characterized by optical and spectral methods. The present paper presents preliminary results of these combined investigations.

Experimental and theoretical investigations of a laser-produced aluminum plasma	PHYSICAL REVIEW E			English	Article							SELF-ORGANIZATION; ABLATION PLUMES; EXPANSION; DYNAMICS; RESISTANCE; PATTERNS; TIME; GAS	The formation and dynamics of a laser-produced aluminum plasma have been experimentally and theoretically investigated. The visible-emitting regions of the plasma form two structures with different lifetimes and expansion velocities. The first part of the transient ionic signal simultaneously recorded by a Langmuir probe presents an oscillatory structure. A hydrodynamic model in a nondifferentiable space-time has been established. The numerical simulation of the plasma expansion showed the plasma plume separation into two patterns. Moreover, the self-structuring of the interface appears through a negative differential conductance and the current oscillations are explained as being induced by thermal fluctuations that appear in the plasma cooling processes.

Structure and mechanical properties of nanocomposites based on polypropilene and polyethylene	JOURNAL OF OPTOELECTRONICS AND ADVANCED MATERIALS			English	Article						polypropilene; polyethylene; nanocomposite; XRD; FT-IR; DSC; AFM	CLAY	Polymer clay nanocomposites are a new class of materials which show improved properties at very low loading levels of nanofiller comparing to conventional particulate composites of thermoplastic material. Polymer nanocomposites exhibit superior mechanical properties, reduced gas permeability, improved solvent resistance and enhanced conductivity over polymers. The enhanced reinforcement is a result of the much greater surface to volume ratio of these high aspect ratio fillers. The effect of clay treatment on physical and structural properties of polypropylene (PP J600) and low density polyethylene (LDPE) nanocomposite have been studied. The analysis of polypropylene and polyethylene nanocomposites was made by means of XRD, FT-IR, DSC and AFM methods.

Fluorescence studies of the self-organization phenomena in film state and solutions of some polyurethanes	JOURNAL OF OPTOELECTRONICS AND ADVANCED MATERIALS			English	Article						polyurethane; film; self-organization; fluorescence		The fluorescence properties of stilbene-polyurethane were studied by means of trans-cis photo isomerism and fluorescent emission of the stilbene in polycation and compared with urethane-stilbene derivative and with another cationorner with fluorophore introduced via quaternization of the same precursor with urethane- stilbene halide. In the case of pyrene-polyurethane the process of excimer formation between the pyrene molecules attached to the ionic polyurethane was investigated in tetrahydrofuran (THF), dimethylformamide (DMF) and film state. The formation of aggregates or core-shell micelles was sustained by the fluorescence data, which indicated the existence of pyrene units in the ground state of the molecule, giving rise thus to an explanation for the high excimer-to monomer intensity ratio.

IR wavelength-selective laser desorption via O-H and C-H stretching modes	APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE			English	Article						selective desorption; photon stimulated desorption; mass spectrometry; OPO; ice; PAH	DESORPTION/IONIZATION MASS-SPECTROMETRY; INFRARED RESONANT DESORPTION; ORGANIC-MOLECULES; ICE; MATRIX; MECHANISMS; IONIZATION; CLUSTERS; EJECTION; SPECTRA	We present new results on wavelength-selective desorption of solid samples using the resonant interaction between the laser beam and the bulk. The experimental set-up is based on the coupling of three techniques: laser desorption in the near-infrared (IR) (2.7-4 mu m) with a tunable IR optical parametric oscillator (OPO), UV multi-photon ionization, and reflectron time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The resonant character of the laser desorption process has been investigated for an ice/polycyclic, aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) mixture, by excitation of the O-H and C-H stretching modes. Highly preferential desorption has been evidenced, with exclusive desorption of water and PAH molecules at the O-H and C-H resonances, respectively. Potential analytical (e.g. selective analysis of complex samples) and technological (e.g. dry laser cleaning, DLC) applications are discussed. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

So, for the fractal dimension D=2, the Schrodinger "fluid" is obtained as an irrotational movement of a Navier-Stokes fluid with an imaginary viscosity coefficient. In the deterministic case, the anodic double layer is described by a set of diffusion-reaction equations, a situation in which the equal diffusion curves are of the Koch-type and the self-structuring is given by means of the coherence of the electron-ion pairs. In the nondeterministic case, the anodic double layer is described by a set of time-dependent Schrodinger-type equations and the self-structuring is given by means of the negative differential resistance and the pulsation-potential linear dependence. Through the spontaneous symmetry breaking the Langmuir's relations, the distributions of the potential field and charge densities have been obtained. The model was verified by means of our experimental data too.

Between these layers a potential jump exists, creating an electric field. A common way to obtain a double layer structure is to positively bias an electrode immersed into stable plasma. Under certain experimental conditions, a more complex structure in form of two or more subsequent double layers was observed, which was called multiple double layers. It appears as several bright and concentric plasma shells attached to the electrode. The successive double layers are located at the abrupt changes of luminosity between two adjacent plasma shells. However, if the electrode is large, the multiple double layers structure appears non-concentrically, as a network of plasma spots, near each other, almost equally distributed on the electrode surface. Each of the plasma spots is confined by an electrical double layer. Here, we will present experimental results on the appearance and dynamics of concentric, as well as nonconcentric multiple double layers. The results prove that the same physical mechanism is at the origin of their appearance in plasma. In this mechanism, the electron-neutral impact excitations and ionizations play the key role.

The desorption products have been analyzed by UV multi-photon ionization and time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Desorption mechanisms and plume dynamics have been investigated by studying the desorption products velocity distribution profiles in the frame of a Knudsen layer model. A peculiar behavior (broadening of the mass spectral lines) of the Ga component was found at high desorption-ionization delays and a tentative explanation has been proposed, based on the very different thermal properties of the sample constituents.

Their thermotropic properties are favored by the presence of diazobenzene and phenol groups within the polymer structure. The diazobenzene groups in the polymer structure confer them characteristics with important application in optics and optoelectronics. The presence of diazobenzene groups in. the molecular structure of the polymeric chain confers it photochromic properties, Due to this property, the anisotropic foils obtained from such a polymer are able to bias the nematic crystal liquid molecules if they come in touch with the foil, when the obtained physical system is UV irradiated. The liquid crystal characteristics of the studied polymers have not been dealt with, since the mesophase occurs at temperatures ranging between 170-200 degrees C, yet certain preliminary research has shown that the oxetane ring from the polymeric chain presumably favours a reticulation process too, occurring around 195 degrees C.

It was experimentally established that the heating velocity during the oxidation process has a strong influence on the electrical and optical properties of films as prepared. The temperature was increased from room temperature to 450 degrees C, with velocities ranging between 0.1 degrees C/s and 0.5 degrees C/s. In2O3 thin films as obtained have been examined for optical transparency function on wavelength. The calculated values of optical band gap range between 2.99 and 3.31 eV. Electrical conductivity measurements have also been carried out on the above oxide thin films as a function of temperature. Both the electrical and optical studies showed that In2O3 thin films with higher transparency and electrical conductivity are obtained at higher oxidation velocities. Also, the experimental results show linear dependences of transmission coefficient on the oxidation velocity. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The polarization spectra of the studied compounds have been obtained. From the analysis of the absorption spectra in polarized light, it has been established that the oscillator responsible for the appearance of the electronic absorption band executes vibrations with an average orientation along the stretching direction of the studied foils.
